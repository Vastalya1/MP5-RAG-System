# MP5-RAG-System

The main objective of this project is to leverage the current technology by developing  an AI-powered system that is capable of answering accurately  most of the user queries related to the domain of medical insurance policy documents and other associated terminology. The proposed system aims to integrate structured information retrieval with a reasoning-based generative model to ensure factual and contextually relevant responses. It is achieved with the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, which grounds the model’s outputs in verified policy data, there on minimizing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability for end users.

**Framework:** LangChain with multi-agent orchestration.

**Embedding Model:** Sentence-BERT for vector creation.

**Database:** ChromaDB with HNSW search.

**LLM:** GPT-based model for generation & query rewrite.


**Modules Implemented:**

Document Ingestion

Query Rewrite

Chunk Retrieval

Response Generator

Agent Controller
